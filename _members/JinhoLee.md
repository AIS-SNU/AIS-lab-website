I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University. My research interests include accelerators and architectural optimizations for AI systems. Before Joining Seoul National University, I was at CS, Yonsei University, and IBM, Austin. I received all my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. from Seoul National University.

I am currently looking for talented students (graduate students, undergraduate interns). Please contact leejinho at snu dot ac dot kr if you are interested.
